Thanks for everyone helping with testing!

Get ready for version 2.0 of the Habitica iOS app!

The apps internals have been completely reworked and rewritten, to allow for faster and easier development in the future and also fixing a lot of long standing issues.

New in this version:
- Sound effects!
- redesigned task form
- redesigned Equipment page
- redesigned Avatar Customization page
- redesigned guild and party page
- redesigned skills page
- redesigned stable
- redesigned class selection screen
- better display for when edits to tasks are still being synced
- Guild invitations are displayed in the guild list and users can respond
- Display if user is buffed
- Themes! You can now choose between 8 different themes for the app (Note that this feature might not be included in the final 2.0, since we are still experimenting with this)
- Delete account from app

Fixes:
- The duplicate items bug is finally gone for good!
- fixed due date not being removable from todo
- Fixed bug where a users party wasn't displayed sometimes
- Fixed shiny seed transformation item not working on mages
- Fixed urls in chat not being clickable
- Fixed backgrounds naming and sorting
- Fixed wolf mounts not being positioned correctly

Known issues in this build:

We're also trying out a new feedback/bug reporting tool called Instabug. If you want to report anything you can shake your device and then the Instabug popup will appear. For those bug reports, a screenshot is also automatically attached (you can edit/remove this if wanted).
